##  Other datasets

[Open Images Dataset V7](https://storage.googleapis.com/openimages/web/index.html)

16M bounding boxes for 600 object classes on 1.9M images

These are a labeled subset of the 80 million tiny images dataset
[CIFAR-100](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html)


From [Perspectives in machine learning for wildlife conservation](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-27980-y)

These datasets contain camera captures.  My impression looking at the images on website is that the quality will not be good enough for a lot of them.
